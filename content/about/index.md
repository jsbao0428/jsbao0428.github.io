## About Me
As a software engineer with 2 years of experience in the E-commerce industry, I've been in charge of model deployment and flow design developed by Python. Furthermore, my focus area also includes Flask API, MySQL, and Docker. As for career planning in the next few years, implementing machine learning models and learning ML Ops are my major objectives.
